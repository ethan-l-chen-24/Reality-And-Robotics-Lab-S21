# Frontier Finding Algorithms

Welcome! This repository contains the entirety of my summer research in the Reality and Robotics Lab with Professor Quattrini Li. 

The code supplied is all of the work (successful or not). To test, run FFGraphics, and to view each individual algorithm, look at files prefixed by `Algo_`.

The major algorithms of interest are `Algo_DDFD` and `Algo_ARFD`, and to learn more about these, check out my website at _journeys.dartmouth.edu/ethanlchen24/_ and look at the research overview under Research!
